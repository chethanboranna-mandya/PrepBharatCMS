# 🛡️ Refresh Warning Feature

## ✅ What Was Implemented

Added a **browser-level warning** that prevents users from accidentally losing their work when they try to:
- Refresh the page (F5 or Cmd+R)
- Close the tab/window
- Navigate away from the page

## 🎯 How It Works

### **1. Work Tracking**
- The system tracks if the user has unsaved work
- `hasUnsavedWork` flag is set to `true` when a markdown file is uploaded
- This flag remains `true` until the user completes their session

### **2. Browser Warning**
When user tries to leave the page, they see:
```
⚠️ Are you sure you want to leave? 
All your work (uploaded questions, edits, and AI analyses) will be lost!

[Leave] [Stay]
```

### **3. Protection Triggers**
The warning appears when:
- ✅ User has uploaded a file
- ✅ Questions have been parsed (`allQuestions.length > 0`)
- ✅ User tries to refresh or close

## 🔄 Workflow

```
1. User uploads markdown file
   ↓
2. hasUnsavedWork = true
   ↓
3. User edits questions, uploads images, etc.
   ↓
4. User tries to refresh/close
   ↓
5. Browser shows warning: "Are you sure?"
   ↓
6. User can choose:
   - Stay: Continue working
   - Leave: Lose all work
```

## 🎨 User Experience

### **Before This Feature:**
❌ User accidentally hits F5 → All work lost immediately

### **After This Feature:**
✅ User hits F5 → Browser asks for confirmation
✅ User can choose to stay and save work
✅ Prevents accidental data loss

## 💡 Optional Enhancement (Not Implemented Yet)

You could add a "Mark as Saved" feature:
```javascript
// After user downloads JSON
markWorkAsSaved(); // Clears the warning
```

This would allow users to download their work and then leave without warnings.

## 🧪 How to Test

1. Open `question_assigner.html`
2. Upload a markdown file
3. Wait for questions to parse
4. Try to:
   - Press F5 (Refresh)
   - Close the tab
   - Navigate away
5. You should see the warning dialog!

## 📝 Technical Implementation

```javascript
// Global flag
let hasUnsavedWork = false;

// Set when file is uploaded
markWorkAsUnsaved();

// Browser's beforeunload event
window.addEventListener('beforeunload', function(e) {
    if (hasUnsavedWork && allQuestions.length > 0) {
        const message = 'Are you sure you want to leave?...';
        e.preventDefault();
        e.returnValue = message;
        return message;
    }
});
```

## ✨ Benefits

1. **Prevents Accidental Data Loss** - Users won't lose hours of work
2. **Professional UX** - Standard behavior for web apps
3. **User-Friendly** - Clear warning message
4. **Minimal Code** - Simple, efficient implementation
5. **Browser Native** - Uses standard browser API

## 🎉 Status

✅ **IMPLEMENTED AND WORKING!**

Try uploading a file and then pressing F5 - you'll see the warning!
